The word *sente* is used in different contexts. In the sentence "Black has
sente." it means that it is black's turn to play. In the sentence "This move is
sente." it means that the player who plays the move can continue to play
elsewhere after the move has been answered. In the sentence "This move was
played in sente." it means that the move was answered.

A move that is *sente* has the characteristic that the expected value at the
start equals the value at one of the leaves of the move-tree, as seen at
location F. This characteristic itself does not make the move *sente*.

What makes a move *sente* is that the answer or follow-up is larger than what
is gained with the *sente* move itself. In the case of location F, the
follow-up is equal to what was gained with the alledged *sente* move.

If the follow-up is also larger than a normal *gote* move elsewhere, then the
*sente* move should be answered, even if it is not the largest move on the
board **[[1]]**. A directive: "Always play the largest move." would be too
simple, wouldn't it?
